<h1>A Theory of Bookmarks</h1>

<p><em>Nov 1, 2016</em></p>

<p>My bookmarks menu used to be a huge mess, so being an engineer instead
of putting up with it I sat down one day and thought about bookmarks
for a while and came up with what I think is the <em>perfect</em> way to
organize them. It works by using a personal web archive to store what
I call <em>reference</em> bookmarks in PDF files, while stuff like your
favorite subreddit goes in the bookmarks bar.</p>

<h2>The Two Kinds of Bookmarks</h2>

<p>The first step to fixing my bookmarks is that I realized that they can
be all be divided into two types:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reference material</li>
<li>Non-reference material</li>
</ol>


<p>Reference material is pages like blog posts and monad tutorials,
basically anything specific that you might want to read later. The
important about them is that they <em>rarely change</em>, so it makes sense
to archive them. Non-reference material is the opposite, they&rsquo;re sites
like your favorite subreddit or the front page of a blog and they
often change <em>daily</em>. They&rsquo;re pages that you visit every day to see
what&rsquo;s new.</p>

<h2>Why Bookmarks are a Bad Idea for Reference Material</h2>

<p>Now that you understand what I mean by reference material, lets talk
about why bookmarks are a terrible way of organizing them:</p>

<ol>
<li>They share space with non-reference bookmarks</li>
<li>They outnumber non-reference bookmarks by a huge margin</li>
<li>You only visit them a couple times a year</li>
<li>You have no guarantee that they will remain available</li>
</ol>


<p>The first three reasons are why your bookmarks menu is a mess. You&rsquo;ve
got a bunch of stuff you hardly ever visit and a few things you visit
every day in the <em>same place</em>. The fourth reason is why bookmarks for
reference material aren&rsquo;t even effective in the long run. You have no
guarantee that that handy git tutorial will be there in a year.</p>

<h2>Solving the Problem</h2>

<p>The solution is to start maintaining a personal web archive. There&rsquo;s a
few ways to save web pages, but I prefer using Print-to-PDF, which is
usually just Ctrl-P (set the destination as PDF). I just save them to
<code>~/web</code> as A4 size pages. This gives me a single self-contained file
of the web page. Another thing I like to do is use a tool like
<a href="https://pdfgrep.org/">pdfgrep</a> to search the entire archive.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After I started doing this, I&rsquo;ve managed to shrink my bookmarks down
to about 60 items. That&rsquo;s a lot better than the hundreds it used to
be, and they fit nicely into 7 folders. If you&rsquo;re willing to try out
my method, remember to backup your existing bookmarks by exporting
them to HTML before you start deleting them.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
