<h1>How I Organize My Bookmarks</h1>

<p><em>12 Nov 2016</em></p>

<p>I have a slightly quirky way of organizing my bookmarks, but my
friends tell me it&rsquo;s actually very good so I&rsquo;m sharing it here with
everyone else. In a nutshell, it works by storing what I call
<em>reference</em> bookmarks as PDF files, while stuff like your favorite
news sites go in the bookmarks bar. This not only helps keep your
bookmarks slim, but also fights linkrot.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that organizing your bookmarks seems to be a pretty
personal thing from what I&rsquo;ve seen, so don&rsquo;t be surprised if this
doesn&rsquo;t make sense for you. This is mainly for people struggling with
a huge amount of bookmarks.</p>

<h2>The Two Types of Bookmarks</h2>

<p>Before I explain how my method works, I want to show how I came up
with it. The first thing I realized is that all bookmarks can be
divided into two types:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reference material</li>
<li>Non-reference material</li>
</ol>


<p>Reference material is pages like blog posts and monad tutorials,
basically anything specific that you might want to read later. The
important about them is that they <em>rarely change</em>, so it makes sense
to archive them. Non-reference material is the opposite, they&rsquo;re sites
like your favorite subreddit or the front page of a blog and they
often change <em>daily</em>. They&rsquo;re pages that you visit every day to see
what&rsquo;s new.</p>

<h2>Why Bookmarks are a Bad Idea for Reference Material</h2>

<p>Now that you understand what I mean by reference material, lets talk
about why bookmarks are a terrible way of organizing them:</p>

<ol>
<li>They share space with non-reference bookmarks</li>
<li>They outnumber non-reference bookmarks by a huge margin</li>
<li>You only visit them a couple times a year</li>
<li>You have no guarantee that they will remain available</li>
</ol>


<p>The first three reasons are why your bookmarks menu is a mess. You&rsquo;ve
got a bunch of stuff you hardly ever visit and a few things you visit
every day in the <em>same place</em>. The fourth reason is why bookmarks for
reference material aren&rsquo;t even effective in the long run. You have no
guarantee that that handy git tutorial will be there in a year.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>The solution is to start maintaining a personal web archive by saving
your reference bookmarks to a file (don&rsquo;t bookmark them!). There&rsquo;s a
few ways to save web pages, but I prefer using Print-to-PDF, which is
usually just Ctrl-P (set the destination as PDF). I just save them to
<code>~/web</code> as A4 size pages. This gives me a single self-contained file
of the web page. When you&rsquo;re done archiving your reference bookmarks,
your bookmarks bar should only contain non-reference bookmarks.</p>

<p>Another thing I like to do is use a tool like
<a href="https://pdfgrep.org/">pdfgrep</a> to search the entire archive for
text. As for sharing your archived reference pages, the PDFs contain
the URL of the site they were saved from, so if you ever want to share
one with a friend just copy the link.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Yeah, I might be overthinking this, but I&rsquo;ve also managed to cut my
bookmarks down to about 60 items and just 7 folders. That&rsquo;s a heck of
a lot better than the hundreds I used to have, and now I never have to
worry about linkrot either. If you feel like trying out my method,
remember to backup your existing bookmarks by exporting them to HTML
before you start deleting them.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
