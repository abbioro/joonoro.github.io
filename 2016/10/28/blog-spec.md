# Blog Post Specification
*Oct 28, 2016*

The first line should be a first level heading containing the title of
the post. The second line should include the date of the post, in
italics.

## Subheadings

Subheadings shouldn't freak out, so this is here as a test. Here's
some code while I'm at it:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	printf("Hello, world!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

Syntax highlighting on websites is for wusses.
