# About Me

I'm Joonatan O'Rourke, I'm a software developer living in Oulu,
Finland. I'm an American-Finnish dual citizen. This is my site where I
talk mostly about tech, though I may make a few exceptions.

This site is generated from Markdown using a little script I wrote
that's available along with the rest of the site on
[Github](https://github.com/joonoro/joonoro.github.io). It's nothing
too fancy, but it gets the job done.
