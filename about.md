# About Me

I'm Joonatan O'Rourke, I'm a software developer living in Oulu,
Finland. This is my blog where I talk mostly about tech, though I may
make a few exceptions.

## About this blog

My blog is generated from Markdown using a little script I wrote
that's available along with the rest of the blog on
[Github](https://github.com/joonoro/joonoro.github.io). It's nothing
too fancy, but it gets the job done.
